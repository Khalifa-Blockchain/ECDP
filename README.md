# EthicalDeFi - Powering DeFi On Ethical Wheels (Moved into [The Setheum Monorepo](https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum)).

⚠️WIP - Work In Progress, Not Production Ready!

### The Structure Of The EthicalDeFi Suite:
1. `swap`: DEX
2. `open-liquidity-mining`: Liquidity Mining Incentives for DEX
4. `ecdp/unpegged` -> `setter`(SETR): Unpegged Stablecoin
5. `ecdp/pegged` -> `slickUSD`(USSD): Pegged Stablecoin
7. `liquid-edf`: Allow users to issue ECDP Stablecoins with `EDF(EthicalDeFi)` collateral and get `LEDF(Liquid EthicalDeFi)` liquid collateral. Only works for `ecdp/pegged -> slickUSD(USSD): Pegged Stablecoin`.
3. `liquid-see`: Liquid Staking `SEE(Setheum)` for staking rewards and `LSEE(Liquid SEE)`.
